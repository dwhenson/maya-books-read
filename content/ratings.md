My ratings are tough by design. Here's a guide:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse;--starred-color:#ff7300"><p><strong>One star</strong> means a book is rubbish. Not worth the time. If I don't finish it I will include it on the home page, but not on my record of books read.</p>{{< rating "1" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse;--starred-color:#ff7300"><p><strong>Two stars</strong> means a book is just OK, nothing more. I probably had to put some effort in to complete it. I would not read it again or recommend it.</p>{{< rating "2" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse;--starred-color:#ff7300"><p><strong>Three stars</strong> means a book is good - consider it recommended. I would read it again, but it's probably not going to change your life.</p>{{< rating "3" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse;--starred-color:#ff7300"><p><strong>Four stars</strong> means a book is great. I thought about reading it when I wasn't, and would look forward to getting back to it. I would definitely read it again.</p>{{< rating "4" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse;--starred-color:#ff7300"><p><strong>Five stars</strong> means a book is practically perfect in every way. When I wasn't reading it, all I wanted to be doing was reading it.</p>{{< rating "5" >}} </div>
