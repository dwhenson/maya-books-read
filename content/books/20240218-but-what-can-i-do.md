I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't. I enjoy the informal tone of Alastair Campbell on his podcast with Rory Stewart, but I didn't warm to it at all in the witten form. I found that 95% of the book was the warm up to what I actually wanted to learn from this book: what I can I to help make politics better in this country. I hope that it serves to motivate people to get involved in politics, but this one wasn't for me.
