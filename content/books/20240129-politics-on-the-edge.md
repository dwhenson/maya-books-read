I have a bit of a man crush on Rory Stewart and was excited to receive this book as my leaving gift. I enjoyed it, although it is a bit of a depressing take on the state of UK politics and the way things work — and things have only got worse since Rory’s time. The book was split into three main acts focusing on: getting elected and representing Cumbria; time spent as junior and then more senior government minister; and Rory’s run for leader of the Conservative Party. It’s a testament to the writing that I was rooting for Rory to win the contest even though we all know the outcome. Well worth a read.
