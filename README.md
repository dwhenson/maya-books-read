# book-records

[Live Preview](https://hugo-books-read.vercel.app)

A simple site to record the books I've read. Built using [Hugo]() as a way to get familiar with it for my day job. 

Cover images from: [Bookshop.org](https://uk.bookshop.org/).

Usage: To create a new book from archetype add the date in the format yyyymmdd and the book title as follows: `hugo new content books/{{yyyymmdd}}-{{book-title}}.md`
